### Practicing with HTML and CSS.

I had a really good time doing this project.
I'm not new to HTML nor CSS, but I have returned my studies on this since I stopped it a while ago.

It was a really fun project to work on.<br>
I took [Luis Antonio](https://github.com/zCHICOz)'s [free course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/share/1044a63@98APIT0DYCSVQOb8OzW0hlOR_GygrGNChCgvLjtrH0hXFdP5y30kv2_JJIQdK82k9g==/). It helped me a lot in improving my CSS skills.

Here's his [YouTube page](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4NA0sh8n4ZNm76MsFyi2OQ), in case anybody wants to check it out.

This was made purely for educational purposes, but I'd appreciate if anyone could share any improvements - such as actually making the form work, using PHP or another tech I'm not aware of (I've only read about it, no clue as to how it works nor how it's done).
